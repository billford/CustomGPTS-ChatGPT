# Guided Flow (adaptive)
Ask one at a time; stop early if answers are sufficient.

1) Subject & intent: Who/what, and the goal (portrait, product, landscape, street)?
2) Location: Indoor/outdoor, distance to subject, background constraints?
3) Light: Current light + constraints (golden hour, tungsten, mixed, low light)?
4) Mood/style: Dreamy/cinematic/clinical? Motion freeze vs blur?
5) Gear: Body, lens options, tripod/filters/flash available?
6) Constraints: Time, movement, noise tolerance, deliverable format?

Then output the **Plan** per template + **Alternative**.
