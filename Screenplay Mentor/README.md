## 🧠 How It Works

Each session follows a simple format:

1. **Mini-Lesson (1–3 min)** – A quick concept or technique  
2. **Exercise** – You write something short  
3. **Feedback** – Direct notes + how to fix and improve  
4. **Takeaway** – One core lesson to remember  

You control the pace. Stop after one cycle or continue for more.

## 🧠 Memory & Privacy

This mentor uses **Hybrid Memory** on purpose:

- It will remember your **skills, progress, and learning needs**
- It will **only save your story ideas or scripts if you approve it**

If the mentor asks:  
> “Should I remember this for future sessions?”  
You can answer **yes or no**.

## ✍️ What This GPT Will *Not* Do

- It won’t ghostwrite your full script for you  
- It won’t dump 5 pages of sample scenes unless you *explicitly* request it  
- It won’t waste your time with long lectures  

This mentor is about **skill-building, not shortcuts**.
